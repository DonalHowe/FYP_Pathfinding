main classes
	grid - the grid which stores cells and will run the pathfinding 
		- inside grid you will have a star and d star funcs 
			
	cell/node - this is what each node will contain i.e marked, x/y pos etc
	gameManager - this game manager will basically contol where blocks/ obstructions are placed it will also know which cells are affected so it will pass
			this information to d star only if the path is affected
			
		key: if the path is infected the game manager will only pass the information through to the dstar within a certain range i.e say 6 cells away
			this for one stops the uneccessary overhead of storage required for dtar on in a massive grid 
			Draw back is that it may have to do a drastic change in direction

			or i could have dstar check every 5 cells ahead though there is a possibility for it to miss the obstruction 
			
			the game manager will also control the storage of results for instance it will store the data into the sql database where they will be sorted by 
			big O notation 

	Game - runs the file basically wont do much more else bar setup how and when these things a run
